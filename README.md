# Shortest Path Finder
## Description
Shortest Path Finder is a React project that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between a start and an end node. It provides a simple and efficient solution to determine the shortest path in a graph.

Dijkstra's algorithm guarantees finding the optimal solution by iteratively exploring the graph and updating the distances to each node.
